Wow, you visited my profile. Miracle!

# Introductions
Name's Mohamed Abduljawad, or known as xXhtmlProgrammer2021Xx... I mean... Salint, known as Salint. I'm a 16 year old programmer. I come from a small pyramid in the sands of Egypt. 

My birthday is 10th of March, 2005.
I've been coding since I was 9. 6 years ago!

I really like Minecraft.

# Experience
Well, I ***melt*** in game development. I have a bit of experience with Unity and UnitySharp. I love Web Development, so... HTML(piece of cake), CSS(an even smaller piece of cake), JavaScript(the virgin language with 2 children, don't ask questions), as well as TypeScript and ReactJS! PHP as well, I don't get why people dislike it, the syntax is <3.

Moving on, I have quite some experience in Java and JavaFX. And I am an intermediate in C and C++.

# Goals
- Build a game engine.
- Make a games company.
- Make an empire like Microsoft and Google.


I like to dream.
